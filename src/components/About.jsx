        <p>
          I am a motivated and detail-oriented Information Technology student
          with strong skills in full-stack web development, especially in the
          MERN stack. I enjoy building modern, responsive, and scalable web
          applications that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience in developing both frontend and backend
          projects, working with REST APIs, and managing databases. I am a
          quick learner who constantly explores new technologies to improve
          my skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My goal is to grow as a software engineer and contribute to
          innovative projects while continuously learning and improving.
